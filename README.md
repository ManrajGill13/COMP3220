## Phase Plan
We will be using various github tools to continue to the development stage of our project and write a program that is able to take a .CSV file and convert it into an SQL table.

Our UML diagram explains the program's process of converting .CSV data to a table in an SQL database. All objects and entities are connect to the load data object where jobs can be split up and distributed to different functions. It then becomes the data object's job to create job queries and convert the .CSV file entries them into a table for the database. We were able to find such a file from the City of Windsor's data catalogue about schools in the city. Our goal in this phase is to have some level of working code that can accomplish these tasks.

## Code Repository - https://github.com/ManrajGill13/COMP3220-Elaboration-Phase
We will be using Githubâ€”a great tool to host software development projects and maintain organized documentation. Our code for reading csv files from the city of windsor website is written in the repository along with our UML diagrams.

## Version Control - Git for VCS
To record any changes made to this repository, we will be using Git. It allows us to preview past versions of the repository and direct those changes to newer versions of the project. It's an extremely useful tool that provides a fallback if project development goes wrong.

## bug reporting tool - Github issues 
Github issues is a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for any project. They share the functionality of e-mailing except they're much more manageable and effectively shared with all collaborators of a project.

## project management - Github Boards
To help us organize and prioritize work on this assignment, we will be using Github Project Boards. It allows team members to track the progress of the project and work accordingly to occupy themselves with other areas of work.

## Testing Strategy - Test-driven development (JUnit)
We are using the following data to test whether our program will work or not: https://opendata.citywindsor.ca/opendata/details/211
Its data will be tokenized and then stored as an SQL database.

## Documentation Repository - https://github.com/ManrajGill13/COMP3220-Elaboration-Phase
We are using github to record documentation in the code as well as a code repository because we feel keeping all our processes on the same platform is much more efficient.
