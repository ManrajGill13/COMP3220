## Code Repository - https://github.com/ManrajGill13/COMP3220-Elaboration-Phase
We will be using Githubâ€”a great tool to host software development projects and maintain organized documentation. Our code for reading csv files from the city of windsor website is written in the repository along with our UML diagrams.

## Version Control - Git for VCS
To record any changes made to this repository, we will be using Git. It allows us to preview past versions of the repository and direct those changes to newer versions of the project. It's an extremely useful tool that provides a fallback if project development goes wrong.

## bug reporting tool - Github issues 
Github issues is a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for any project. They share the functionality of e-mailing except they're much more manageable and effectively shared with all collaborators of a project.

## project management - Github Boards or Trello

## Testing Strategy - Test-driven development (JUnit)
