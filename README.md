## Code Repository - https://github.com/ManrajGill13/COMP3220-Elaboration-Phase
We will be using Githubâ€”a great tool to host software development projects and maintain organized documentation. Our code for reading csv files from the city of windsor website is written in the repository along with our UML diagrams.

## Version Control - Git for VCS
To record any changes made to this repository, we will be using Git. It allows us to preview past versions of the repository and direct those changes to newer versions of the project. It's an extremely useful tool that provides a fallback if project development goes wrong.

## bug reporting tool - Github issues 
Github issues is a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for any project. They share the functionality of e-mailing except they're much more manageable and effectively shared with all collaborators of a project.

## project management - Github Boards
To help us organize and prioritize work on this assignment, we will be using Github Project Boards. It allows team members to track the progress of the project and work accordingly to occupy themselves with other areas of work.

## Testing Strategy - Test-driven development (JUnit)
We are using the following data to test whether our program will work or not: https://opendata.citywindsor.ca/opendata/details/211
Its data will be tokenized and then stored as an SQL database.
